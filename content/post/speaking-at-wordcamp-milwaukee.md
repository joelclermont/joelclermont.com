Just a quick note that I'll be speaking at WordCamp Milwaukee on June 3. The talk is titled "Contributing to Open Source Projects". It's not really a WordPress specific topic, but more of a general encouragement for everyone to get involved in open source and how specifically to go about it. Read the [official brief on the WordCamp site](http://2012.milwaukee.wordcamp.org/session/contributing-to-open-source-projects/).
