Thanks to everyone who attended my talk today, especially those that asked questions and gave me feedback afterwards.

I'm posting my slides for the talk I gave at WordCamp Milwaukee today. As with most talks, there is a lot more information than what the slides contain, but at least it is something.
<!-- more -->
I also heard that the video recording of my talk will be posted to wordcamp.tv at some point too. Once I get that link I'll post it here.
