Are you expecting too much from an author, speaker or teacher? Take charge of your own learning instead. Consider some tips from a recent <a href="http://www.joelclermont.com/2014/01/26/learning-how-to-learn-the-newsletter/" target="_blank">"Learning how to Learn" newsletter</a>.

## Effective learning is not passive

My goal with this newsletter is to provide an idea, tip or strategy that you can
immediately put into practice to become a more effective learner. In order to
benefit, though, you need to both *read* the information and then *try it out* on
your own. Even if it seems silly, obvious, irrelevant, just try it. Reading
should take no more than 5 - 10 minutes. I will keep each article brief and
focused and give you a link to more information if your curiosity is piqued.

This idea of trying something out is the focus of our first installment. So
often, we approach learning as a passive process. We may not explicitly think
about it that way, but the assumption is there. In fact, it was likely planted
there as a child. Think of how you were taught in school: A teacher lectured,
maybe assigned some additional material to read on your own, and then you were
given homework to demonstrate that you learned the day's lesson. Your job was to
pay attention, ask a question if something was unclear, then go off on your own
and try to reproduce what you learned by completing an assignment.

Now think about how you approach learning today as a professional. You buy a
book, attend a workshop or conference, watch a video. Many times, that's it.
There isn't even any homework to try to prove to yourself that you learned
something. In this approach, just simply taking in information, whether it's by
reading or listening, feels like an accomplishment. I finished that book! I
heard some awesome talks at a conference! I have new knowledge! But do you?
Perhaps you were exposed to some new ideas, but did you really understand them?
Have you applied them to your own projects or problems?

This is where many end up feeling frustrated. They invested their time and
money, but they don't really feel any further ahead than before. Unfortunately,
I'm going to break some bad news: The solution is to actually make yourself more
frustrated. You need to flip the whole process of learning on its head and view
it as an activity that you are driving, not the author or speaker or teacher.

There is a growing movement among college professors, especially in the field of
mathematics, called Inquiry Based Learning. Instead of lecturing or assigning
reading, they start by presenting some very basic facts or definitions, and then
propose problems for the students to solve. Here's the tricky part: they never
explicitly showed the student how to solve the type of problem before.
Initially, many students find this bewildering and frustrating. How can they
possibly solve something they haven't yet been taught to solve? But, as they
persevere and explore the topic through trial and error and discuss it with
fellow students, they do eventually reach the solution. Perhaps it takes them
several classes, or even a couple weeks, but once they've found the solution, it
has a much more profound impact on them. Studies have shown that you are more
likely to remember something you discover in this way than something merely
taught by rote in a lecture or book.

Isn't that what we, as software developers, want? We want to truly gain new
concepts, new ways of thinking, new methods of solving problems. We don't just
want to memorize solutions in hopes that we can apply them to a real-world
problem some day. Here's the catch though: very few software books are written
in this style (see below for an exception). Instead, it's a more traditional
written recitation of facts and information. But, by shifting our mental model
of how learning takes place, we can still apply these same concepts as we learn.

**Don't learn too much at once.** Focus on one idea or concept before moving on. In
a typical book, this will often be far less than a single chapter.

**Try it out as soon as possible.** Don't cut and paste code, instead try to reimplement it
yourself from memory. If you can't remember, don't immediately go back to the
book or search the Internet. Stick with it, try and fail, experiment, make it
work.

**Challenge the author's statements.** Try to prove them wrong. Extend their ideas.
In what situations does it work and it what situations does the solution break
down?

**Concepts, not solutions.** The goal is to improve your ability to solve problems,
not to merely solve a contrived set of problems presented in the book. What is
the core idea being taught? Can you restate it? Can you defend it?

Yes, this approach is a lot more work, but that is the point. You are teaching
yourself. You are exploring ideas on your own, thereby really mastering them. In
the end, you will have actually learned something and not just feel like you
should have learned something.

For more information on the concept of Inquiry Based Learning, check out this
video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6t6WiWYdgY" target="_blank">Creativity in Mathematics: Inquiry-Based Learning and the Moore Method</a>. If you can get past the cheesy
music and the fact that it's focused on mathematics, you'll see the benefit of
this approach to learning.

Okay, so you read the whole article. Remember that is ONLY step one. Now go, try
this out!

P.S. One notable example of a book taught in the spirit of inquiry-based
learning is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992" target="_blank">The Little Schemer</a> (and others
in that family). Even if you never plan on writing Scheme/Lisp, I highly
recommend working through this book. It will give you new ways of thinking about
software, ideas that transcend a specific language.
