Ever wish you could listen to Aaron and I talk about random programming topics? Well do I have some news for you.

<!--more-->

Over the years, [Aaron](https://www.aaronsaray.com) and I have worked with a number of Laravel teams. Along the way, we've refined our opinions on how to write reliable and maintainable software, especially a SaaS product built by a team of developers. 

Every other week, we'll pick one tech topic and discuss it in 10 minutes or less. Then we'll take a couple minutes to get a little goofy on a non-tech topic because we're not robots and we like to have fun.

If that sounds interesting to you, check out the [podcast home page](https://show.nocompromises.io) and subscribe today!
