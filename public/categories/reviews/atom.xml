    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the next week, I'm going to be adding quite a few short posts chronicling my experience at the <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> conference. The event is a few years old, but this is the first year I'm attending.</p>

<p>Just arriving at the Kalahari resort, I can already tell this is going to be quite unlike any conference I've previously attended. I had a 7 hour drive from Milwaukee, so I headed straight to my room to crash, but I'll be exploring the facility more tomorrow. Speaking of the rooms, I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious it was and all the amenities I had, especially considering the low rate. Kudos to the organizers for getting such a great deal for attendees.</p>

<p>CodeMash doesn't even start until Wednesday, so I have two days to bulk up on sleep and get the lay of the land. If you're attending, drop me a note and let's get together for a meal or just some drinks.</p>
