    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year at <a href="http://www.thatconference.com">That Conference</a>, I presented one of the few talks on PHP. The title of the talk was "<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jclermont/a-modern-approach-to-php-development">A modern approach to PHP development</a>." My goal was to expose both PHP and non-PHP developers to some more recent developments in the PHP ecosystem.</p>

<p>Speaking of non-PHP developers, I was pleasantly surprised to see about a dozen .NET developers attend the talk. The opening keynote that day was by Dave Thomas and he promoted the idea of exposing yourself to things outside your normal interests. I know for myself, I really enjoy attending polyglot conferences for that very reason.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jclermont/a-modern-approach-to-php-development">slides</a> are posted on Speaker Deck. I have to warn you in advance that very little content is in the slides. Most of it was me speaking from my experience on how I've used the tools and how they made my development more efficient, higher quality and more fun. I did type up some speaker notes and exported those as part of the slide deck, to give a little context to the slides.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to everyone who attended my talk today, especially those that asked questions and gave me feedback afterwards.</p>

<p>I'm posting my slides for the talk I gave at WordCamp Milwaukee today. As with most talks, there is a lot more information than what the slides contain, but at least it is something.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I also heard that the video recording of my talk will be posted to wordcamp.tv at some point too. Once I get that link I'll post it here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note that I'll be speaking at WordCamp Milwaukee on June 3. The talk is titled "Contributing to Open Source Projects". It's not really a WordPress specific topic, but more of a general encouragement for everyone to get involved in open source and how specifically to go about it. Read the <a href="http://2012.milwaukee.wordcamp.org/session/contributing-to-open-source-projects/">official brief on the WordCamp site</a>.</p>
