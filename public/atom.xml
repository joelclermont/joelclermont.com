One of the things I found incredibly useful was understanding all the available lexers and which language code would invoke them.</p>

<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you want to have a code block that highlights both PHP and HTML. How would you do this?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently moved my blog from WordPress to <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. The experience was painless and I wish I would have done it much earlier. One thing that puzzled me was how Octopress handled PHP syntax highlighting. It seemed that it would only work if every code block started with the opening <code>&lt;?php</code> tag. I found this quite annoying, especially when I only want to show one line of code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have the habit of picking up a new programming language or two each year, not necessarily to master them or even to write production code with them, but just to be exposed to new approaches to familiar problems. For the last few months, <a href="https://twitter.com/donatj">two</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/henderjon">friends</a> of mine have been urging me to try out <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, a relatively new language from Google. Since I had a 17-day vacation planned in Florida, I decided to give Go a try while I had abundant free time.</p>

<p>Here is the five-second marketing pitch from Google regarding Go:</p>

<blockquote><p>Go is an open source programming environment that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.</p></blockquote>

<p>Beyond that, one thing that kept coming up when I heard people talk about Go was how it handled concurrency. My focus lately has been on writing scalable web services, so concurrency is something that gets my attention.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, I finally blocked some time to seriously investigate Vagrant and Puppet. The documentation for both tools is decent.</p>

<p>Taking the knowledge I gained from reading through the &#8220;Quick Start&#8221; documents, my next logical step was to spin up my own custom development environment for local usage. I quickly ran into some issues and wanted to enable the &#8220;debug&#8221; mode of Puppet. Since I&#8217;m not calling Puppet directly, it&#8217;s not as easy as tacking on a <code>--debug</code> option to the puppet command line. Instead, I need to tell Vagrant to run Puppet in debug mode, using the Vagrantfile.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was frustrated watching the news tonight, seeing reports of long lines of people waiting to buy lottery tickets for tonight&#8217;s $500,000,000+ jackpot. There are several angles of absurdity to consider here. For example, why all the excitement over $500 million? Wouldn&#8217;t any of these players be equally thrilled by $10 million or even $5 million? Another example: Several of the people interviewed, who had just bought <em>hundreds</em> of dollars of tickets, were unemployed, facing foreclosure, struggling to pay medical bills, and so forth. But putting all that aside, let&#8217;s just look at the math.</p>

After <a href="https://twitter.com/jclermont/status/250635149824360449">tweeting about my enrollment</a>, a few people responded with curiosity, intrigued at the idea, but not yet ready to put down the money to join. <a href="https://twitter.com/jclermont/status/257103933389033472">Today was orientation</a>, so I decided to start documenting my experiences right away, not only for my own benefit, but also for those perhaps on the fence about taking this class themselves.</p>

It&#8217;s no surprise that I love two-factor authentication then. Not only can I have a super strong password, but I can now require that I have a security token in my possession in order to login. In other words, even if you knew my 16 character random password for gmail, you still could not login without also having my security token.</p>

As you click around the github project site, you&#8217;ll get the sense that all these layout guides and widgets and buttons and icons look oddly familiar. Part of that is the fact that Twitter itself is built with this style package. But even beyond that, <a href="http://builtwithbootstrap.com/">many many many many sites</a> are using this tool kit as well. I&#8217;ve sensed a little backlash, mostly from designers, at this rampant use of the Twitter Bootstrap. At a certain level, I agree, but I&#8217;m here to talk about why I love Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most web sites use third-party code. This code comes in a few different flavors:</p>

<ul>
<li>client-side libraries (jQuery, dojo)</li>
<li>server-side libraries (form mail scripts, oAuth integration)</li>
<li>server-side frameworks (Zend Framework, Symfony)</li>
<li>entire applications (WordPress, Joomla)</li>
</ul>


<p>As a developer, when you selected one or more of these tools, you hopefully picked a project that was active and well supported. This means there will inevitably be upgrades to that third-party code. Some of these upgrades add features, but most upgrades also include bug fixes and security patches.</p>
