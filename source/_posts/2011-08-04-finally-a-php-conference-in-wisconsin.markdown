I'm a huge fan of [php|architect](http://www.phparch.com/): the magazine, the books, the online training and especially their conferences. Living in the Milwaukee metro area, I have a short 90 minute drive to the flagship [php|tek conference](http://tek.phparch.com/) they host in Chicago each year. My schedule doesn't always allow me to attend, but I do everything I can to make it. I'm still putting into practice the things I learned at php|tek 2010 and I regularly keep in touch with the many friends I met there.

That being said, it came as a very welcome surprise today when I opened my mail and found an invitation to [CodeWorks 2011](http://codeworks.phparch.com/) in Madison, Wisconsin! CodeWorks is a single-day, single track conference focused on PHP, but historically, it's stayed pretty far away from Wisconsin. I suspect this is because we already have php|tek in our backyard, but I always lobbied hard to have a CodeWorks stop near us as well. Let's face it: not everyone can take a week off work to attend php|tek, not to mention the travel and hotel expenses. Don't get me wrong, it's worth every cent, but for those that haven't experienced it firsthand, it may be a big pill to swallow.

With a CodeWorks coming to my home state, I am going to sing (or at least blog) about it from the rooftops. I want the Madison event to be a success so there's a higher likelihood it may return in 2012. I'll be preaching about it at our next several [Milwaukee PHP meetings](http://www.mkepug.org/), as well as on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/jclermont). With the low cost and the location, if you are a PHP developer in southern Wisconsin (or even northern Wisconsin or Minneapolis), you have run out of excuses not to attend.
