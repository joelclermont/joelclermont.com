### March 2013 - [Midwest PHP Conference](http://midwestphp.org)

Learning How to Learn [Slides and feedback on joind.in](https://joind.in/talk/view/8196)

I gave this presentation as the opening keynote for the conference.

As developers, we are constantly faced with new things to learn. New versions of languages, new tooling, new best practices, and so on. How do you cope with it all? In this talk, I'll get a bit meta and talk about learning how to learn. We like our code to be efficient, so why shouldn't our learning be efficient as well?

### December 2012 - [Milwaukee PHP User Group](http://www.mkepug.org)

MKEPUG's December meetup is going to be a coding event, centered on the Composer project. To start, I will give a brief (20 minute) intro to Composer: what it is, how it works, why you should use it. Then I'll give an overview of the night's events. Our goal as a group will to be submit a few patches to the Composer project. It could be a bug fix, documentation contribution or new unit tests. This will not only help the project, but it will give everyone in the group some real-world experience in contributing to open source.
